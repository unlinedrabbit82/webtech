        <h2>Recap on Backrooms </h2>
            <p>The Backrooms are an anomalous, non-Euclidean construct consisting of countless interconnected “Levels.” These Levels range from monotonous office spaces to industrial corridors, abandoned commercial zones, and reality-breaking voids.</p>

        <h2>Where can I read more?</h2>
       
        <p>My favorite wiki is the backrooms wikidot, it is held as the standard website for the backrooms. 
            other websites include:
            <ul>
                <li>Backrooms fandom</li>
                <li>liminal archives</li>
                <li>The wikipedia article "the backrooms" </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Featured Exploration</h2>
        <ul id="navimg">
            <li><a href="levels.html"><img src="assets/img/levels.jpg" alt="Levels list"></a></li>

            <h2>Authors Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Honestly, I can say the backrooms has been one of my longest hyperfixations I have ever had, I believe I am going on 8 years. I first heard of this topic In VR on a game called "gorilla tag", that game is a whole event on its own. But I really am enjoying this project, even as I'm working at 4:36 AM LOL.</p>
