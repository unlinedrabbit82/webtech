        <h2>What Are The Backrooms? </h2>
            <p>The Backrooms are an anomalous, non-Euclidean construct consisting of countless interconnected “Levels.” These Levels range from monotonous office spaces to industrial corridors, abandoned commercial zones, and reality-breaking voids.</p>

        <h2>Common features include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>non architecture</li>
            <li>Low-grade ambient noise (fluorescent buzzing, pipe flow, mechanical droning) </li>
            <li>Unpredictable geometry (loops, mirrored spaces, shifting corridors) </li>
            <li>Varying environmental hazards </li>
            <li>Confirmed hostile entities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Physical laws fluctuate from Level to Level, with spatial instability most prominent during solitary traversal.</p>

            <h2>Authors Choice</h2>
            <p>The Hub is an expansive underground network of brick-lined corridors, acting as a central junction between countless Backrooms levels. It contains entrances to most known levels, each secured behind steel doors that appear at inconsistent and ever-shifting locations. The tunnels are lit by warm orange-yellow lamps placed at regular intervals, though these lights occasionally shift in color, glowing deep red or vivid orange. While this change poses no real danger, many wanderers find it noticeably disorienting.</p>
